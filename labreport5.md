# Week 5 Lab Report

Source used for this lab report - Chatgpt (I asked it what are some variations of wc that I can use in the command line terminal).

I very much enjoyed learning about the variations of commands in lab report 3. 
Thus, in this lab report, I will be focusing on the command 'wc' and 4 different ways to use it in the terminal. 

**Variation 1:
wc -l filename.txt**
This variation of wc displays only the number of lines in the file. 



**Variation 2:
wc -w filename.txt**



It is the same case for the word 'tourist'.
**Variation 3:
wc -m filename.txt**





**Variation 4:
wc -c filename.txt**

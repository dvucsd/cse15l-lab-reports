# Week 5 Lab Report

Source used for this lab report - Chatgpt (I asked it what are some variations of wc that I can use in the command line terminal).

I very much enjoyed learning about the variations of commands in lab report 3. 
Thus, in this lab report, I will be focusing on the command 'wc' and 4 different ways to use it in the terminal. 

**Variation 1:
wc -l filename.txt**
This variation of wc displays only the number of lines in the file.

**Variation 2:
wc -w filename.txt**
This variation of wc displays only the number of words in the file.

**Variation 3:
wc -m filename.txt**

This variation of wc displays only the number of characters in the file.

**Variation 4:
wc -c filename.txt**

This variation of wc displays only the number of characters in the file.

To conclude, these wc commands in the terminal are much more convenient than opening up the file and manually counting each line, or word or character. By having direct to these commands access in the terminal, users are able to save a lot of time, rather than opening them up in a separate text editor. These variations are also easy to memorise, and combined with other variations, the command wc makes for a powerful tool in analysing the contents of a file.

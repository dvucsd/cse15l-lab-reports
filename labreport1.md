# Week 1 Lab Report


Hello students!

This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started with cse15L. There will be three parts to this tutorial:

  1. Installing VsCode
  2. Remotely Connecting
  3. Trying some commands

**Installing VsCode**

Visit the VsCode website at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Read the instructions on how to install the program onto your computer, 
depending on which operating system you have (MacOS, Windows, etc).

For Mac, you should extract the file and drag it into your applications folder.

From the applications folder, double click and click open when the warning prompt pops up.

When installed, open the Visual Studio Code app and you should see something like this:

You may have a different menu screen.

**Remotely Connecting**

If you are on Windows, you will need to install git at [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Open a terminal in VSCode using 'Ctrl + `' (Command + ` for Mac users), or by using the Terminal tab. 

Run this command, replacing the zz with the letters in your account for this course. 

`ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` 

Since it's your first time logging in, you may see something like this:

Type yes, then enter your password.

You should see something like this once you have successfully logged in. You may have to wait a while, if you have just recently reset your password.
Well done! Your terminal is now connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and commands you run will run on that computer.

**Trying some commands**

Here are some commands for you to play around with:

- cd ~
- cd
- ls -lat
- ls -a
- ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
- cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/
- cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt

  I got some interesting results. For example here is what happens when I type in ls -lat. From what it seems, it looks like it prints out all the files
  and the user associated to each one, while I was connected to the remote server.
